# Sentiment Analysis of Disneyland Visitor Reviews Using Data Visualization

## Project Description:
This project presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis of visitor reviews for Disneyland theme parks, focusing on three major branches: Paris, California, and Hong Kong. By leveraging the power of data visualization techniques, the project aims to uncover valuable insights into visitor sentiments, rating trends, and geographical patterns, providing a holistic understanding of the visitor experience across these popular destinations.
The primary objectives of this analysis include:

## Sentiment Analysis:

Employ advanced text mining and natural language processing techniques to analyze and categorize visitor reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Identify the key factors contributing to positive and negative experiences, enabling targeted improvements.
Rating Trends: Explore and visualize rating trends across the three Disneyland branches, uncovering patterns and variations in visitor satisfaction over time. Analyze the factors influencing rating fluctuations and identify potential drivers behind positive or negative rating shifts.
Visitor Comments Analysis: Conduct an in-depth analysis of visitor comments to gain insights into specific aspects of the Disneyland experience that resonate with visitors. Identify recurring themes, popular attractions, areas of concern, and opportunities for enhancing visitor engagement.
Geographical Analysis: Investigate the geographical origin of visitors and assess how sentiments and ratings vary based on their home locations. Uncover potential cultural or regional differences in visitor preferences and experiences, enabling tailored strategies for different markets.
Recommendations for Improvement: Based on the comprehensive analysis, provide data-driven recommendations for each Disneyland branch to enhance visitor satisfaction. Address specific areas of improvement, capitalize on positive trends, and suggest strategies for targeted marketing and operational enhancements.

## Key Aspects:

1. Dataset: The analysis is based on a dataset containing visitor reviews for Disneyland parks, including details such as ratings, review text, visitor locations, and timestamps.
Data Preprocessing: Extensive data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are employed to handle missing values, remove irrelevant information, and prepare the data for analysis.

2. Sentiment Analysis: Advanced natural language processing techniques, such as text mining, topic modeling, and sentiment classification, are utilized to extract sentiment scores and categorize reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
3. Data Visualization: Interactive visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, symbol maps, and word clouds, are created using powerful data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI. These visualizations aid in understanding rating trends, geographical patterns, and popular aspects and areas of improvement based on visitor comments.
4. Interactive Dashboards: Intuitive and user-friendly dashboards are developed, combining multiple visualizations and enabling seamless exploration of the data. These dashboards facilitate data-driven decision-making by providing a comprehensive view of visitor sentiments and experiences.

By leveraging the power of data visualization and sentiment analysis, this project aims to provide valuable insights to Disneyland management, enabling them to make informed decisions, enhance visitor satisfaction, and tailor their offerings to meet the evolving needs and preferences of their global audience. The findings from this analysis will contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of visitor sentiments and facilitate targeted improvements across all Disneyland branches.
